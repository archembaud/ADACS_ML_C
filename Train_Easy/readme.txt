In this folder, you will find 400 files designed to be used for training a binary 
classification AI as part of the ADACS ML workshop.
These files are written in binary format, with:
* Each X_LIGO file containing 200,000 double-precision values (DATA SET), and
* Each Y_LIGO file containing a single double precision value (CLASSIFICATION TYPE, either 0 or 1)

These signals will need to be filtered before feeding into an AI. Or not. See what happens if you don't.
